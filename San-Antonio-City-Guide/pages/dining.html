			<h3>The Big Bib</h3>
			<a href="http://thebigbib.com/" target="_blank"><img src="../img/dining/4.jpg">
			<p>In true Texas-style, The Big Bib's barbecue is slow-cooked for up to 14 hours every day with aged oak and mesquite woods. This time-consuming process gives the meat a pink tinge called a "smoke ring" and is a prized attribute in barbecue meats. In beef the ring is a reddish-pink and in pork, chicken and turkey it's bright pink.</p></a>

			<h3>Mezcaleria Mixtli</h3>
			<a href="http://www.mezcaleriamixtli.com/" target="_blank"><img src="../img/dining/5.jpg">
			<p>The Mezcaleria, located at the Yard shopping center in the Olmos Park neighborhood in central San Antonio, focuses on Mexican-centric flavors and features Mexican spirits such as tequila and the largest variety of mezcals you'll find in the city.

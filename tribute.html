						<p class="intro">Nikola Tesla is a very prolific and influential figure in the area of science and innovation. He is the creator of a number of inventions and tools that are integral to our modern society. Yet, history has not been particularly kind to the legacy of his work. His name does not have the same prominence as an Edison or an Einstein, which is a true injustice. Tesla was a scientific genius, but that scientific prowess did not transfer to his business sense. Many of his discoveries were left unpatented and were left vulnerable to others coming in to take credit, with perhaps the most famous being Thomas Edison. That being said, let's take a look at the life of one of the greatest scientific minds of all time.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>1856: </strong>Tesla is born</li>
							<li><strong>1875: </strong>Tesla begins attending the Polytechnic school in Austria. It is here that he begins to study electrical and mechanical engineering.</li>
							<li><strong>1882: </strong> Tesla begins work with the Continental Edison Company in Paris working as an engineer on electric equipment sent from overseas. In this same year, Tesla discovers the magnetic induction field principle, and goes on to revolutionize motors.</li>
							<blockquote>
								It seems that I have always been ahead of my time. I had to wait nineteen years before Niagara was harnessed by my system, fifteen years before the basic inventions for wireless which I gave to the world in 1893 were applied universally.
							</blockquote>
							<li><strong>1884: </strong>With only a recommendation from his former employer who knew Edison personally, Tesla moves to NYC to work at Edison Machine Works. He starts off working with small problems at first, but eventually becomes one of the leading engineers within the entire company.</li>
							<li><strong>1885: </strong>Tesla quits working for Edison after not being paid what he was promised. Edison enlisted Tesla to redesign and improve upon his motors and generators and when Tesla did just that he received no payment. This infuriated him and he left the company.</li>
							<blockquote>
								The spread of civilization may be likened to a fire; first, a feeble spark, next a flickering flame, then a mighty blaze, ever increasing in speed and power.
							</blockquote>
							<li><strong>1886: </strong>After leaving Edison, Tesla forms his own company and calls it the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company. During this time Tesla focuses on building an arc lighting system. He eventually succeeds but all of the profits form the arc lighting system is taken by the investors of the company. After finishing the arc lighting system, Tesla begins pushing for new AC motors. His investors were reluctant due to the fact that DC current was widely used already, and it made nos sense to switch to a new kind of current. The investors leave Tesla and the company shuts down.</li>
							<li><strong>1887: </strong>Tesla improves upon his innovations about AC current and devises a way to successfully utilize AC motors. He partners with George Westinghouse and begins a campaign to commercialize and make AC power the new standard. Edison having a massive stake in the success of DC power is upset and begins to publicly criticize the use of AC motors. Edison uses tactics such as publicly killing small animals such as dogs and cats with AC power to try and derail people from using AC power. Tesla also begins to experiment with what would later be known as X-rays.</li>
							<blockquote>
								Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more.
							</blockquote>
							<li><strong>1891: </strong>Tesla patents the Tesla Coil and becomes a naturalized US citizen.</li>
							<li><strong>1893: </strong>Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse successfully bid for the right to power the Chicago World's Fair. J.P. Morgan and Thomas Edison said they could power the fair for almost $2 million, and are rejected. They, then propose that they could get it done for around $550,000 and are once again rejected. Tesla and Westinghouse say that they could power the fair for around $400,000 and are granted the privilege with their cheaper and more efficient AC power.</li>
							<li><strong>1899: </strong>Tesla's experiments are starting to get bigger and he is in need of a bigger laboratory. He leaves New York and heads to Colorado Springs. When he arrives there, he explains to reporters that he is working on understanding wireless telegraphy. His goal was to send a wireless telegraphy from Pikes Peak in Colorado to Paris.</li>
							<blockquote>
								I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men.
							</blockquote>
							<li><strong>1901: </strong>Construction begins on Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower, backed by a number of investors including J.P. Morgan who donates a total of $150,000 (which is around $3 million today). Before the tower is finished, word starts to spread that there is no way for the power emitted from the tower to be metered. This upsets J.P. Morgan and he no longer provided funds and encouraged other investors to do the same. This left Tesla with no way to continue work on his tower. His AC motor patents also were expired and he could no longer receive royalties from his inventions. It is said that the twoer failure led to the mental breakdown Tesla would eventually succumb to.</li>
							<li><strong>1915:</strong>Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison are considered for the Nobel Prize for Physics. There was talks that the two would both receive it, but due to their fierce animosity toward each other they did not like the idea of sharing it. They also stated that if the other got the Nobel Prize first they would reject it as well, not wanting to receive after the other person. Neither of them would go on to receive it due to their feud. Tesla also files a lawsuit against the Marconi Company for infringement. Tesla can't afford the court fees of going against a large corporation and eventually drops it.</li>
							<li><strong>1916:</strong>Tesla files for bankruptcy.</li>
							<li><strong>1943:</strong>January 7th, Tesla dies of heart failure alone in his room in the New Yorker Hotel. He dies with a large amount of debt owed to various entities.</li>
						</ul>
						<blockquote>
							With ideas it is like with dizzy heights you climb: At first they cause you discomfort and you are anxious to get down, distrustful of your own powers; but soon the remoteness of the turmoil of life and the inspiring influence of the altitude calm your blood; your step gets firm and sure and you begin to look - for dizzier heights.
